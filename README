
I'm currently working through Learning Python the Hard Way V3.0. 
In one of the last tasks a game needed to be created, I had created a small room text based game in an earlier task and needed to develope 
on that. Using new gained skills. I wanted to do something a little different but was stuck for an idea, so after watch some stranger things. 
i thought i'd try create something based on Dungeons and Drangons.

I've incorparted a few features from D&D:
Character Selection
Rolling
Fighting 

It's not the most exciting game and I have definetly done D&D a disserive:
I've only created one scene to test the features. 

I've added as much commenting as i thought neccessary:
I have followed some bad practices which I will hope to improve on. 

All feedback would greatly be appreciated. 

Also any advice on how i could improve the code. 
 *Sentence.py 

I hope to return and improve on this game, but for meantime i need to return to learning. 


Below is a walkthrough.

use Engine.py to run the game.

PC = player character / NPC = non player character

~  ~ = NPC Speech
*  * = PC Speech
>  > = Scene and action description
... = press enter to continue

Keywords can be found in: Dictionary.py ||  {} = dict

Step 1: Enter Name

Step 2: access help guide: (No Guide present yet)

Step 3: Select Character to View

Step 4: Choose playable character:

[Game will now start]
[Scene Yalids Inn]
[Scene Description]

Step 4: What do want to do? [Get a room or Need to Eat] {

key words {room_or_bar}: [get a drink /  i need a room]

If room :
1) Do you know what room [Yes or No] {room_yes_no}

[If no rooms listed]

2) Choose type of room:
keysword {choose_room}: [small,double,large,queen]

elif Bar:
[Scene Descrition]

Step 5: Find out what the NPC's are talking about using a skills:
keyword {get_more_informarion}: [Intimidate/Investigate/Persuade]

each will involve a skill check where you will roll the die:
each can has a positive and negative result.

if you fail:
  use another tactics
  [intimidate] if used a fight can start


If Fight:

initiative roll: Roll to determine fight order:

if you(PC) roll highest you can defuse the situation or choose to fight:
keywords: fight / defuse

if defuse:
you will roll again.

pass = fight defused:
fail = fight

if NPC rolls highest fight will go ahead

fighting:

PC and NPC will take turns to make and attack:

PC
step 1: Choose weapon:

Piril : warhammer / Handaxe
Elkas : javelin / greataxe

step 2: attack roll

step 3: damage roll


process will repeat untill either PC or NPC is unconscious or Dead.

death = <0 Hit Points
unconscious = ==0 Hitpoints

if you fall unconsious:

Perform Death saving throw:
roll 3 saves and you live
roll 3 fails you die.

if NPC is killed or unconscious you are able to get the information you need.

if you lose the fight and live you will have to get the information another way.

you will have to stay in the hotel for the  night if you got a room in the beginning you will go to your room to sleep
else: you will go book a room.

End of Scene.
